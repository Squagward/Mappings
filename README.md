This is my first attempt at an extension, so let's see how this goes!

# How to use:

Open up command palette (ctrl + shift + p), type in Mappings, and click on
`Mappings: Search mappings for classes, methods, or fields`.

Note:

- Right now you can only search using the MCP names. I am planning on adding
  support for SRG names as well.
